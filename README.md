The Code of Ethics for the Assciation of Computer Science Ethics

## Forward

This document is born out of a university classroom teaching professional practices in computer science. It is envisioned as a replacement for any current (as of March 2017) Code of Ethics that could be applied to computer science. Current Codes of Ethics that have been proposed are neither cohesive nor comprehensive such as the [CIPS Code of Ethics (2022)](https://cips.ca/wp-content/uploads/CIPS-Code-of-Ethics-2022.pdf) and the [10 commandments of computer ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments_of_Computer_Ethics).
