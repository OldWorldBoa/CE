# Introduction
This document is intended to address ethical concerns for the discipline of computer science; 
it will be a cohesive and comprehensive document addressing ethics in the discipline of computer science.

## Forward
This document is born out of a university classroom teaching professional practices in computer science. 
It is envisioned as a replacement for any current (as of March 2017) Code of Ethics that could be applied 
to computer science. Current Codes of Ethics that have been proposed are not satisfactory in their 
cohesiveness nor comprehensiveness, such as the 
[CIPS Code of Ethics (2022)](https://cips.ca/wp-content/uploads/CIPS-Code-of-Ethics-2022.pdf) and the 
[10 commandments of computer ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments_of_Computer_Ethics).

## Target Audience
This target audience of this code of ethics is computer scientists interested in the ethics of their work. There is a high chance that this document can be generalized to most computer focused professions, although they aren't the target.

## Contributing
This repository should be updated regularly so as to be kept up to date with the fast paced nature of 
computer science, as well as collaboratively revised. As a guideline; any pull request should be approved 
by the majority of the active members of the association.

## Organization
This repository is organized in the following structure:
- A directory for every item in the table of contents with sub-items
- A markdown file for each item in the table of contents without sub-items

This is meant to keep this repository clean and intuitive.
